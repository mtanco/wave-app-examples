## [Testing Functions](small-testing)
This application has a series of functions for testing various UI bite-sized pieces. Call only one function in the `serve` function. 
Current examples:
* UI table from a data frame
* Show a website in a form card
* Plot data in a `plot_card` and in a `ui.visualization` within a `form_card`
* Learn how to handle misisng values from numpy/pandas objects in plots

## [Upload and Use a Table](upload-and-use-csv)
This application has three main steps:
1. Allow a user to upload a single, csv file 
2. Display that file as a basic `ui.table` object
3. Display a scatter plot of two random fields from the table
